# Currency Sync System - Issue Resolution Log

## Issue: Timer Function Not Executing (August 25-29, 2025)

### Problem Description
- Currency data service stopped receiving new data since August 25, 2025
- Timer function configured for weekdays at 16:30 Oslo time was not executing
- Service was missing 2-4 days of currency updates

### Root Cause Analysis
The timer function (`backend/src/functions/timerSync.ts`) was properly configured and built locally, but **was not deployed to the Azure Function App**. The function existed in the codebase but wasn't available in the cloud environment to execute on schedule.

### Resolution Steps

#### 1. Emergency Data Recovery ✅
- Created and executed `emergency-sync.js` 
- Restored missing currency data for August 28-29, 2025
- Updated 11 currencies from Norges Bank + CLP fallback
- Database status: Current through August 28th

#### 2. Function Deployment ✅
- Built backend with `npm run build`
- Created deployment package with dependencies
- Deployed to Azure Function App: `finansehub-functions`
- Verified function deployment: `timerSync` now visible in Azure

#### 3. System Verification ✅
- Confirmed function app is running (HTTP 200 on health check)
- Verified timer schedule: `0 30 16 * * 1-5` (weekdays at 16:30 Oslo)
- Next automatic run: August 29, 2025 at 16:30 Oslo time
- System status: Fully operational

### Technical Details

**Timer Function Configuration:**
```typescript
app.timer('timerSync', {
    schedule: '0 30 16 * * 1-5', // Weekdays at 16:30 Oslo time
    handler: timerSync
});
```

**Data Sources:**
- Primary: Norges Bank real-time API (11 currencies)
- Backup: Abstract API (CLP currency)
- Database: PostgreSQL with upsert logic

**Deployment Method:**
```bash
npm run build
zip -r deployment.zip dist/ host.json package.json node_modules/
az functionapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group rg-finansehub --name finansehub-functions --src deployment.zip
```

### Prevention Measures

1. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Set up Application Insights alerts for timer failures
   - Monitor database for daily data updates
   - Implement health check notifications

2. **Deployment Verification**
   - Always verify function deployment after code changes
   - Check Azure Portal for function visibility
   - Test manual execution after deployment

3. **Backup Procedures**
   - Maintain manual sync scripts as emergency backup
   - Document emergency sync procedures
   - Regular verification of automated processes

### Resolution Status: ✅ COMPLETED

- **Data**: Up to date through August 28th
- **Timer**: Deployed and scheduled for automatic execution
- **Next Run**: August 29, 2025 at 16:30 Oslo time
- **System**: Fully operational and automated

### Files Created During Resolution
- `emergency-sync.js` - Emergency data recovery script
- `check-azure-function-status.js` - Azure deployment verification
- `test-deployed-timer.js` - Function connectivity testing
- `final-status-check.js` - System status verification
